# Overview

This repo is meant to be a starting point for a Windows-based C++ console game. Yeah, I know it's really dumb, but it's also super fun to play with!

I should mention that it's been quite a while since I've written a lot of C++, and this repo uses C++ version 20, which probably means I'm missing a ton of new features and/or syntax. I'm totally open to any ideas or suggestions to bring it all up-to-date!

# How To Use This

I'm hoping to add some kind of utility (maybe PowerShell script?) where you can download this repo, enter the name of your game in the utility, and all the code and solution files will auto-update from "ConsoleGame" to whatever you choose. It's not hard to do, honestly I just can't decide on what utility to use.

# For Now

Meanwhile, head over to the wiki for an overview of how all this stuff works!
