# Overview

This repo is meant to be a starting point for a Windows-based C++ console game. Yeah, I know it's really dumb, but it's also super fun to play with!

I should mention that it's been quite a while since I've written a lot of C++, and this repo uses C++ version 20, which probably means I'm missing a ton of new features and/or syntax. I'm totally open to any ideas or suggestions to bring it all up-to-date!

# How To Use This

To start your own game based on this repo, just follow these steps:

1) Download the repo (or clone it, or whatever you want, just get it on your local machine).
2) In the repo's root folder, run the `SetupRepo.bat` script.
3) Once you've followed the instructions and (hopefully) successfully given your game a unique name, open the solution file and go nuts!
4) This is optional, but if you want to clean things up, you can safely delete these:
   - `SetupRepo.bat`
   - The entire `ConsoleGameSolutionSetup` folder
   - The entire `RepoSetupFiles` folder

(Note that you don't even have to do step 2, as long as you're okay with the name "ConsoleGame")

# So How Does This Even Work?

I've included some code to get you started, but you'll want to [head over to the wiki](https://github.com/elgasste/ConsoleGame/wiki) for all kinds of helpful documentation!
