# Overview

This repo is meant to be a starting point for a Windows-based C++ console game. Yeah, I know it's really dumb, but it's also super fun to play with!

I'm hoping to add some kind of utility (maybe PowerShell script?) where you can download this repo, enter the name of your game in the utility, and all the code and solution files will auto-update from "ConsoleGame" to whatever you choose.

Meanwhile, head over to the wiki for an overview of how all this stuff works!
